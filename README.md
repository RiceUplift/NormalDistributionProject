# NormalDistributionProject
(Click on the .py file to see the solution.)
This is my solution to the normal distribution project. Remember that there are many ways to solve this problem in Python and my solution is meant to reflect what we have learned in class so far, not nesseccarily the most efficient or shortest method. You also do not need the #~~~~~~~~~MAIN CODE BELOW HERE~~~~~~~~~#
part of the code. This is meant to be a visual representation for how to organize your code. We will learn how to formalize the notion of a "main" function after Thanksgiving break.
